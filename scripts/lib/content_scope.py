"""Shared scope policy for ``content_validation`` enforcement.

Defines which markdown files in ``docs/`` are required to carry the
``content_validation:`` frontmatter block (factual-claim pages) versus those
that are out of scope for the dashboard and cleanup tool (navigation indexes,
KQL packs, lab guides, tutorials, reference look-ups, and other non-claim
content).

Out-of-scope pages are not counted by
``scripts/generate_content_validation_status.py`` and are not required to
carry a ``content_validation`` block. Legacy blocks may still exist on some
out-of-scope pages from before this scope policy was formalized; they are
accepted but not tracked, and will be reviewed in a follow-up editorial pass.
New out-of-scope pages should not add the block.

Imported by:

- ``scripts/generate_content_validation_status.py``
- ``scripts/remove_tautological_validation.py``

The policy MUST stay in sync with ``AGENTS.md`` §Content Validation Scope.
If you change the rules here, update ``AGENTS.md`` in the same commit.
